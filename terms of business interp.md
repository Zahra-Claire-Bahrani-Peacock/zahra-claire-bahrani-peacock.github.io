By accepting the quote verbally, in writing or through payment, you agree to the following Terms of Business as displayed in the document held by Zahra-Claire Bahrani-Peacock.

**1. Definitions and Interpretation of this Agreement**
   1. Definitions  

      In this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, the following expressions shall be given the following meanings:  
      
      <u>‘Agreement’</u> means these General Terms of Business and any other agreements laid out in writing by the Parties.  

      <u>‘Client’</u> means the Party commissioning Interpreting in the normal course of business.  

      <u>‘Intellectual Property Rights’</u> means copyright and related rights; performers’ rights; moral rights; goodwill and the right to sue for passing-off or unfair competition; rights to use and protect the confidentiality of confidential information (including know-how and trade secrets); and any other intellectual property rights of any person, including such rights or similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection which subsist or will subsist now or in the future in any part of the world.  

      <u>‘Interpreter’</u> means the party providing Interpreting in the normal course of business. The Interpreter shall normally be the person performing the Interpreting unless the Client has been explicitly informed that the Interpreting Task will be subcontracted, or the Interpreter customarily trades as an intermediary.  

      <u>‘Interpreting’</u> means work produced by or carried out by the Interpreter which calls upon the interpreting skills of an Interpreter, but not any written translation work.  

      <u>‘Interpreting Task’</u> means providing Interpreting as commissioned by the Client in accordance with this Agreement.  

      <u>‘Isolated Use’</u> means that, where the Client is acting as an intermediary, the Client has only used the Interpreter’s services once within a 12 month period.  

      <u>‘Recordings’</u> means the recording and fixation of the Interpreting in all media, including transcripts, audio and/or visual recordings and television, web and online broadcasts or as otherwise specified in writing by the Parties.  

      <u>‘Source Material’</u> means the underlying material (delivered in any medium by the Client) which is to be interpreted by the Interpreter in the performance of the Interpreting Task.  

      <u>‘Third Party’</u> means any party who is not a party to this Agreement.  

      <u>‘Third Party Rights’</u> means any right, title or interest of any person (which shall include any natural person, a corporate or unincorporated body) and that person’s successors or assigns, including any Intellectual Property Rights of such person.  

      <u>‘Written Instructions’</u> means any additional instructions detailing the requirements of the Interpreting Task, provided by the Client to the Interpreter, that form part of this Agreement.  

   2. Interpretation of this Agreement  

      In this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires:  
      
      No part of any numbered clause shall be read separately from any other part.  
      
      A reference to a statute or statutory provision is a reference to it as amended, extended, or re-enacted from time to time.  
      
      References to a “Party” or the “Parties” mean the parties to this Agreement. Such Parties may be natural or legal persons, including, for example, private individuals, associations, partnerships, economic interest groupings or corporate entities.  
      
      Any words following the terms “including”, “include”, “in particular”, “for example” or any similar expression shall be construed as illustrative and shall not limit the sense of the words, description, definition, phrase or term preceding those terms. 

   3. Interpreting only  
      
      Unless explicitly agreed by the Parties in writing, this Agreement shall only apply to Interpreting carried out by the Interpreter, which (for the avoidance of doubt) will not include translation (except for any sight translation that arises during the Interpreting itself, which shall be included within the scope of this Agreement), or any other work undertaken by the Interpreter. Such additional work will be undertaken and billed pursuant to a separate contract between the Parties.  

**2. Third Party Rights**
   1. The Interpreter accepts an Interpreting Task from the Client on the understanding that performance of the Interpreting Task will not infringe any Third Party Rights. Accordingly, the Client warrants to the Interpreter that:
      - the Client has full right and authority to enter into this Agreement and possesses the necessary authority to interpret the Source Material and exploit any Recordings of the Interpreting; and
      - the Source Material does not infringe the copyright or any other Third Party Rights of any person.  

   2. The Client shall indemnify the Interpreter against any loss, injury or damage (including legal costs and expenses and compensation paid by the Interpreter to compromise or settle any claim) which the Interpreter suffers as a consequence of any breach or alleged breach of any of the above warranties or as a consequence of any claim that the Interpreting contains anything objectionable, defamatory, blasphemous or obscene or which constitutes an infringement of copyright or any other Third Party Rights.  

**3. Fees: (binding) Quotations, (non-binding) Estimates and Expenses**
   1. In the absence of any specific agreement, the fee to be charged, whether this is a fixed fee or an hourly rate, shall be determined by the Interpreter on the basis of the Client’s description of the Interpreting Task, the purpose of the Interpreting, the duration of the Interpreting Task including the length of the event(s) at which the Interpreter is to interpret and the required arrival time of the Interpreter at the venue, the time and day that the Interpreting is to take place, the venue or platform where the Interpreting Task is to take place or be performed and any instructions given by the Client including whether the Interpreting is to be recorded and the use of personal protection equipment.

   2. No fixed quotation shall be given by the Interpreter until he/she has received clear and complete instructions in writing from the Client.

   3. An estimate shall not be considered contractually binding but given for guidance or information only.

   4. Where VAT is chargeable it will be charged in addition to the quoted fee and expenses.

   5. Any fee agreed for an Interpreting Task which is found to present latent special difficulties of which neither party could be reasonably aware at the time of offer and acceptance shall be renegotiated in good faith, always provided that the circumstances are made known to the other Party as soon as reasonably practical after they become apparent.

   6. Subject to clause 3.2 above, a binding quotation given after the Interpreter has seen the complete instructions shall remain valid for a period of thirty (30) days from the date on which it was given, after which time it may be subject to revision.

   7. If travel time and other expenses are not agreed and included on the Cover Sheet, then reasonable expenses associated with the completion of the Interpreting Task, for example travel, hotel and subsistence expenses, shall be borne by the Client. If excessive expenses are incurred as a result of action or inaction by the Interpreter, these shall not be borne by the Client unless otherwise agreed.

   8. Additional time will be charged in ½ hour increments using the Interpreter’s hourly rate as a basis for the calculation.

**4. Delivery & Substitutions**
   1. If reasonably practical, the Interpreter shall be entitled to take reasonable breaks throughout the Interpreting Task, as agreed in advance between the Parties.

   2. Where the Client commissions an Interpreting Task involving simultaneous interpreting, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, it will ensure that there are at least two interpreters (including the Interpreter) for each language and that adequate equipment is provided to all interpreters for the Interpreting Task.

   3. The Interpreter reserves the right to substitute themselves, provided the Client is reasonably satisfied that any proposed substitute possesses the necessary skills and qualifications for the satisfactory completion of the services. The Interpreter will remain liable for the services completed by the substitute and will bear any costs.

**5. Payment**
   1. Payment in full to the Interpreter shall be effected no later than thirty (30) days from the date of invoice, by the method of payment specified.

   2. The Client shall pay the Interpreter additional fees at the Overtime Rate(s) (as set out in 3.8) if the Interpreting Task lasts for a longer duration than specified in the original instructions.

   3. For ongoing Interpreting Tasks, the Interpreter may request an initial payment and periodic partial payments on terms to be agreed.

   4. For first time clients, the Interpreter may request an initial payment before the Interpreting Task commences.

   5. Settlement of any invoice, part-invoice or other payment shall be made by the due date agreed between the Parties or in the absence of such agreement within the period stipulated in clause 5.1.

   6. Where the Interpreting Task is ongoing and is to be conducted in instalments, and notice has been given that an interim payment is overdue, the Interpreter shall have the right to stop working on the Interpreting Task until the outstanding payment is made or other terms agreed.

**6. Intellectual Property Rights**
   1. In the absence of a specific written contract to the contrary and to the extent that it is possible in law, Intellectual Property Rights in any Recordings or part thereof will remain the property of the Client.

   2. Where the Interpreter retains any Intellectual Property Rights in the Recordings, unless otherwise agreed in writing, every Recording shall carry the following statement: "© [Language(s) booked] Interpreting by Zahra-Claire Bahrani-Peacock [year]" as appropriate to the particular case.

   3. It shall be the duty of the Client to notify the Interpreter that a Recording will be made of the Interpreting.

   4. If an Interpreting or Recording is in any way amended or altered without the written permission of the Interpreter, he/she shall not be in any way liable for amendments made or their consequences.

   5.

The right of integrity may be specifically waived in advance by the Interpreter in writing.

**7. Confidentiality**
   1. Any agreement between the Parties which imposes confidentiality obligations upon the Interpreter shall not apply to information where the Interpreter is able to prove:
      - that it was already in his or her possession at the date it was received or obtained in connection with this Agreement; or
      - that it was obtained from some other person who is not in breach of any confidentiality undertakings; or
      - that it has been independently developed by or for the receiving party; or
      - that it came into the public domain or is common knowledge otherwise than through the default or negligence of the receiving party; or
      - that the receiving party is required to disclose it pursuant to any applicable laws or the order of any competent court or other regulatory authority.

   2. The Interpreter shall at all times exercise reasonable discretion in respect of disclosure to any Third Party of any information arising from or during the Interpreting Task without the express authorisation of the Client, except in the instance of simultaneous interpreting, where it is expected that the Interpreter may work with other interpreters present in order to complete the Interpreting Task effectively.
