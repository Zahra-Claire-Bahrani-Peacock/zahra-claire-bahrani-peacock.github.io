Hi there and welcome to my website.  
<br/>
My name is Zahra-Claire Bahrani-Peacock. I am a sworn, state-certified translator and interpreter.  
<br/>
I grew up bilingual in the UK with English and German, spending extended periods each year in Germany and Spain. As intercultural communication has always played such an important role in my life, I decided to move to Germany after finishing my A-Levels to study translation and interpreting with a focus on economics at Munich’s Municipal Foreign Languages Institute (FIM).   
<br/>
The course was very practically orientated, equally combining practical work with the theory of translation, interpreting and economics. The fact that the course was taught in German allowed me to gain in-depth knowledge of the language and culture, sparking my interest in localisation as I compared and contrasted the three cultures I had spent so much time in.  
<br/>
After finishing the course in 2018 and becoming a State-Certified Translator and Interpreter, my next goal was to become fluent in Spanish. I moved to Malaga, Spain, and completed a 9-month internship at the translation agency BigBabbling as their in-house translator, proofreader and project manager for English and German. I had a high degree of responsibility, which allowed me to pick up invaluable skills and knowledge, creating the foundation for where I am today.  
<br/>
Having worked part-time as a translator and interpreter since 2017, I decided to make it a full-time occupation in 2019. I used the knowledge I have gained through various internships that I have completed over the years, my work with children and my long-term hobbies including cooking, equestrianism, sustainability, reading and a general appreciation of the outdoors to define the areas that are of particular interest to me, adding to these the economic and educational elements as well as the legal element, through my appointment as a sworn court translator and interpreter for the English language through the Regional Court of Munich&nbsp;I.  
<br/>
Experiencing first-hand and from a young age the problems that people face when they do not speak the same language, my passion has always been to overcome these barriers, to make communication possible and to help people of different cultures be successful in communicating with other.
