Hi there and thanks for visiting my page.  
<br/>
My name is Zahra-Claire Bahrani-Peacock and I am a sworn, state-certified translator and interpreter.  
<br/>
I grew up bilingually in York, UK, with English and German, spending the summer holidays of each year in Bavaria, Germany and Andalusia, Spain and, as I grew up, the holidays in between with various student exchange partners. As one might imagine/deduce from this, language and intercultural communication has always played an important role in my life, so when the time came to choose A-Levels, languages, business and art seemed like an obvious choice. Later on, it simply made sense to move abroad to study translation and interpreting with a focus on economics at Munich’s Municipal Foreign Languages Institute (FIM).  
<br/>
The course was very practically orientated, equally combining practical work with the theory of translation, interpreting and economics. The fact that the course was taught in German allowed me to gain in-depth knowledge of the language and culture, sparking my interest in localisation, as I compared and contrasted the three cultures I had spent so much time in.  
<br/>
After completing the course in 2018 and becoming a State-Certified Translator and Interpreter, my next goal was to become fluent in Spanish and it was clear that I would only achieve this if I moved to Spain and worked in a professional environment.  So, I packed my bags and moved to Malaga, where I completed a 9-month internship at the translation agency BigBabbling as their project manager and in house translator for Spanish into English and German. I had a high degree of responsibility, which allowed me to pick up invaluable skills and knowledge, creating the foundation for where I am today.  
<br/>
Having worked part-time as a translator and interpreter since 2017, I decided to make it a full-time occupation in 2019. I used the knowledge I have gained through various internships that I have completed over the years, my work with children and my long-term hobbies including cooking, equestrianism, sustainability, reading and a general appreciation of the outdoors to define the areas that are of particular interest to me, adding to these the economic and educational elements, as well as the legal element, through my appointment as a sworn court translator and interpreter for the English language through the Regional Court of Munich&nbsp;I.  
<br/>
Experiencing first-hand and from a young age the problems that people face when they do not speak the same language, my passion has always been to overcome these barriers, to make communication possible, to help people of different cultures be successful in communicating with other.
