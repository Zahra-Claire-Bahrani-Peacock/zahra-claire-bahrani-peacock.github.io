Hi there and welcome to my website.  
<br/>
My name is Zahra-Claire Bahrani-Peacock. I am a sworn, state-certified translator and interpreter.  
<br/>
I grew up bilingual in the UK with English and German, spending extended periods each year in Germany and Spain. As intercultural communication has always played such an important role in my life, I decided to move to Germany after finishing my A-Levels to study translation and interpreting with a focus on economics at Munich’s Municipal Foreign Languages Institute (FIM).     
<br/>
In 2017, during my last year on the course, I began working part-time as a freelance translator and interpreter, working on various projects such as a website, business correspondence, poems and presentations.    
<br/>
After completing the course in 2018 and moving to Spain, I did a 9-month internship at a translation agency in Malaga as their in-house translator, proofreader and project manager for English and German, whilst continuing to work part-time as a translator. It was in 2019 that I decided to dedicate myself full-time to my own translation and interpreting business.      
<br/>
Experiencing first-hand and from a young age the problems that people face when they do not speak the same language, my passion has always been to overcome these barriers, to make communication possible and to help people of different cultures be successful in communicating with other.
